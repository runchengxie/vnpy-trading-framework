    "# Algorithmic Trading for Reversion and Trend-Following<br>均值回归与趋势跟踪的算法交易\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic trading in HFT space is concerned with how to optimally run the core strategies focusing on execution. The issues of order types as allowed by broker/exchange, slippage, and algorithm ability to manage risk come before the mathematical and statistical nuances of strategy. However, this is a quantitative study project. Therefore, with attention to maths and application detail (e.g., sample period/time window experiment) implement at least two kinds of strategy: (a) a trend-following strategy with several indicators of your choice AND (b) reversion strategy with an indicator of your choice. Part I. That you can do as a historic back-test but encouraged to use data of higher frequencies, rather than daily (e.g., 15 Min).<br>高频交易（HFT）领域的算法交易研究，核心在于如何以最优方式执行策略，重点关注交易执行层面。经纪商/交易所允许的订单类型、滑点问题以及算法管理风险的能力，这些要素的优先级高于策略本身的数学与统计细节。然而，本项目作为定量研究课题，需特别关注数学建模与应用细节（例如样本周期/时间窗口实验），要求实现至少两种策略：(a) 自选多种指标的趋势跟踪策略；(b) 自选指标的均值回归策略。第一部分可采用历史回测方法，但鼓励使用15分钟级别等更高频数据（而非日线数据）进行验证。\n",

    "In Parts II and III extend the strategies from back-testing to some degree of live-testing to test simple scripts with Broker API of your choice. However, if specific Broker API/language learning curve is steep, you can limit the scope – Part II covers more detail. Real-time trading relies on loops which check for buy/sell signal, and to improve the performance more optimized languages than Python are used in the industry, e.g. GoLang. A. The trading code must handle exceptions: failures during the order execution and inconsistent/incorrect information received back from the broker (e.g., order filled when it wasn't, mismatch in order type). B. Trading overall should consider liquidity, market impact, and sudden market events – though you are not likely to be in position to affect the market but consider,<br>在第二和第三部分中，将策略从回测扩展到一定程度的实盘测试，使用您选择的经纪商API测试简单的脚本。但是，如果特定经纪商API/语言的学习曲线陡峭，您可以限制范围——第二部分会涵盖更多细节。实时交易依赖于循环检查买卖信号，并且为了提高性能，业界通常使用比Python更优化的语言，例如GoLang。A. 交易代码必须处理异常：订单执行过程中的失败，以及从经纪商收到的不一致/错误信息（例如，订单显示已成交但实际未成交，订单类型不匹配）。B. 整体交易应考虑流动性、市场影响和突发市场事件——尽管您不太可能影响市场，但需要考虑，\n",

    "\n",
    "Trend-following strategies aim to capitalize on sustained movements in the market. The indicators such as the **Moving Averages**, **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** and **Average Directional Index (ADX)** to confirm trends. The ADX measures the strength of a trend, helping to filter out weak trends that may not be profitable. You can combine moving averages with ADX, in order to generate better quality trading signals.<br>趋势跟踪策略旨在利用市场的持续性运动来获利。诸如**移动平均线（Moving Averages）**、**指数移动平均线（EMA）** 和 **平均趋向指数（ADX）** 等指标用于确认趋势。ADX衡量趋势的强度，有助于过滤掉可能无利可图的弱趋势。您可以将移动平均线与ADX结合使用，以生成更高质量的交易信号。\n",

Discuss or better back-test the impact of various market-specific events/liquidity conditions/regime in asset price.<br>通过实验调整重采样间隔和平均周期，以评估您特定趋势跟踪方法的有效性。讨论或最好通过回测来评估各种市场特定事件/流动性状况/资产价格状态变化对策略的影响。\n",

    "\n",
    "Write code that implements testing on your core strategies, that can be done Python and on historical data (back-testing). Understanding mathematical nuance of indicator, and its back-testing has different purposes, as compared to live-testing which would focus on order slippage, for example. Here, you are not limited to Python, and can use a specialized language + Broker API for Part I as well. There are **Backtrader**, **Zipline**, **PyAlgoTrade** packages but Python doesn't have a ready one solution for our Part I purposes.<br>编写代码以实现对您核心策略的测试，这可以在Python中完成，并使用历史数据（回测）。理解指标的数学细微差别及其回测，与侧重于订单滑点等的实盘测试有不同的目的。在此部分，您不局限于Python，也可以使用专门的语言+经纪商API。虽然有**Backtrader**、**Zipline**、**PyAlgoTrade**等包，但Python并没有一个现成的解决方案能完全满足我们第一部分的需求。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a core trend-following strategy kind, common choices are **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** and **Average Directional Index (ADX)**, which is a kind of oscillator. Other approach is a convergence/divergence indicator, **Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)**. For each strategy, you need to decide on: your own indicator, how it is computed, and what constitutes a trading signal (e.g., crossover of 20D EMA with another).<br>对于核心的趋势跟踪策略类型，常见的选择是**指数移动平均线（EMA）**和**平均趋向指数（ADX）**（一种震荡指标）。另一种方法是收敛/发散指标，如**移动平均收敛/发散指标（MACD）**。对于每种策略，您需要决定：您自己的指标、其计算方式，以及什么构成交易信号（例如，20日EMA线与另一条线的交叉）。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simple but practical trend indicator primarily used in FX is of the following design:<br>一个简单但实用、主要用于外汇市场的趋势指标设计如下：\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Step 1:** resample the prices at regular intervals (e.g., 30 seconds) for price level or average; Can use `DataFrame.resample`;<br> **步骤1：** 按固定间隔（例如30秒）重采样价格，得到价格水平或平均值；可以使用`DataFrame.resample`；\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Step 2:** calculate an average price over the longer period (e.g., 5-minute intervals).<br>**步骤2：** 计算更长周期（例如5分钟间隔）的平均价格。\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Step 3:** compute the ratio of short-term price (or its average) to long-term average price. Ratio close to 1 signals 'no trend' as short-term prices ≈ the long-term prices. Uptrend is signaled by the ratio above 1, and downtrend by less than 1. Implement trading logic to open a position when market prices deviate from that average, and close when prices revert: how large/small the ratio should be before it's a considered buy/sell signal is your experiment and design.<br>**步骤3：** 计算短期价格（或其平均值）与长期平均价格的比率。比率接近1表示“无趋势”，因为短期价格 ≈ 长期价格。比率大于1表示上升趋势，小于1表示下降趋势。实现交易逻辑：当市场价格偏离该平均值时开仓，当价格回归时平仓：比率需要多大/多小才被视为买/卖信号，这是您的实验和设计内容。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Present full mathematical description of the trend-following indicators chosen. Experiment with the ratios, adjust the time period and provide the summary of that analysis.<br>提供所选趋势跟踪指标的完整数学描述。通过实验调整比率、时间周期，并提供该分析的总结。\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For a mean-reversion strategy kind,<br>对于均值回归策略类型，\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Z\\* deviation from the price can be used as a simple signal. Or think about distance measures from machine learning.<br>价格的Z\\*偏差可以用作简单信号。或者考虑机器学习中的距离度量。\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Formal modeling of mean-reversion with OU process can be invoked expecting the price to mean-revert over short-time.<br>可以调用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck（OU）过程对均值回归进行形式化建模，预期价格将在短期内回归均值。\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **OPTIONAL** To generate a stable P&L from reversion strats, very likely that Kalman/unscented filtering needs to be applied to the price (see Topic TS).<br>**可选：** 为了从均值回归策略中产生稳定的损益（P&L），很可能需要对价格应用卡尔曼/无迹滤波（参见主题TS）。\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Discussion. Consider the regime implications: for example, would the upward trend with more jumps and volatility (over the period) produce worse or better returns for the specific indicator/strategy?<br>讨论。考虑市场状态（regime）的影响：例如，在考察期内，伴随更多跳跃和波动的上升趋势，是否会使特定指标/策略产生更差或更好的回报？\n",

    "## Part II: Broker API<br>第二部分：经纪商API\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The common API choice is **REST** (Representational State Transfer).<br>常见的API选择是**REST**（表述性状态转移）。\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Alpaca**, **Interactive Brokers Web**, and **Oanda** all have their own versions. In particular, **Alpaca** REST API is free and includes asynchronous events handling based on **WebSocket** and **Server Side Events (SSE)**.<br>**Alpaca**、**盈透证券（Interactive Brokers）Web** 和 **Oanda** 都有各自的版本。特别是，**Alpaca** REST API 是免费的，并包含基于**WebSocket**和 **服务器发送事件（SSE）** 的异步事件处理。\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **REST API** is referred to as **HTTP API** because it utilizes HTTP methods, e.g. **GET** (retrieve data), **POST** (create new data), **PUT** (update data). Useable for non-time-critical operations such as retrieving historical data, account information, placing orders, and getting order status.<br>**REST API** 被称为**HTTP API**，因为它利用HTTP方法，例如**GET**（检索数据）、**POST**（创建新数据）、**PUT**（更新数据）。适用于非时间关键的操作，如检索历史数据、账户信息、下订单和获取订单状态。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The more industrial strength and lower latency API choice is **FIX** (Financial Information eXchange). A messaging protocol designed for the **real-time** exchange of securities transactions. It supports submission and cancellation of various order types, trade execution reports, and market data dissemination – all for high frequency. FIX is used by large institutions, funds, and broker/dealers.<br>更具工业强度和更低延迟的API选择是**FIX**（金融信息交换协议）。这是一种专为证券交易的**实时**信息交换设计的消息传递协议。它支持各种订单类型的提交和取消、交易执行报告以及市场数据分发——全部面向高频交易。FIX被大型机构、基金和经纪商/交易商使用。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactive Brokers** offer **TWS API** with connection to their client application and possibility to use **C++**, **C#**, **Java**, **Python**. Useful comparison of these API but not an endorsement is available at [www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041).<br>**盈透证券（Interactive Brokers）** 提供 **TWS API**，可连接到其客户端应用程序，并支持使用**C++**、**C#**、**Java**、**Python**。关于这些API的一个有用比较（非官方推荐）可在 [www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041) 找到。\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Treat this project as more professional in regard to the trading, e.g., instead of **Yahoo!Finance**, fetch your data from **OpenBB/brokerage** and think of data quality.<br>在交易方面，将此项目视为更专业的实践，例如，不要使用**Yahoo!Finance**，而是从**OpenBB/经纪商**获取数据，并考虑数据质量。\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe order types suitable to your traded assets, and attempt code for handling orders using the API. Set price parameters far from the market to avoid execution. It is an absolute recommendation though that you use a paper trading account.<br>描述适合您交易资产的订单类型，并尝试编写使用API处理订单的代码。将价格参数设置在远离市场的位置以避免执行。绝对推荐您使用模拟交易（paper trading）账户。\n",

    "## Part III: Evaluate Risk and Test Thrice<br>第三部分：评估风险并反复测试\n",
    "\n",
    "An opened market position is exposed to various types of risk. While the market risk can be managed using simple quant methods like rolling **VaR**, order handling risk is more important and should be addressed in Part II.<br>已开立的市场头寸面临各种风险。虽然市场风险可以通过滚动**VaR**等简单的量化方法进行管理，但订单处理风险更为重要，并应在第二部分中加以解决。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Handling.** Code must have verification mechanisms for server responses. On the broker side and for whichever reason, orders may be cancelled, partially filled or even returned with an incorrect fill information.<br>**事件处理（Event Handling）。** 代码必须具备服务器响应的验证机制。在经纪商端，无论出于何种原因，订单都可能被取消、部分成交，甚至返回错误的成交信息。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positions Tracking.** Code can request account updates (e.g., in loop) to provide a secondary confirmation layer.<br>**头寸跟踪（Positions Tracking）。** 代码可以（例如，在循环中）请求账户更新，以提供第二层确认。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Market Data.** Introduce simple checks to catch inconsistencies in market data, received from the broker. Which checks will depend on the asset and application, for example, futures price can't be below spot price or lead to a negative implied quantity.<br>**市场数据（Market Data）。** 引入简单的检查来捕捉从经纪商接收到的市场数据中的不一致性。具体检查将取决于资产和应用场景，例如，期货价格不能低于现货价格，或者不能导致负的隐含数量。\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance and Risk Reporting.** Please realize that Portfolio/Statistical Arb systematic back-testing scorecards, **Pyfolio** are of less utility in algo trading (e.g., concentration in asset, **Beta-to-SPY**). However, certain performance ratios, turnover/costs information, **Drawdowns** and rolling **VaR** can be adapted. Provide examples of this (end of Part II or end of report).<br>**绩效与风险报告（Performance and Risk Reporting）。** 请认识到，投资组合/统计套利系统性回测记分卡（如**Pyfolio**）在算法交易中（例如，考虑资产集中度、**对SPY的Beta值**）的实用性较低。然而，某些绩效比率、换手率/成本信息、**最大回撤（Drawdowns）**和滚动**VaR**可以进行调整应用。请提供这方面的示例（可在第二部分末尾或报告末尾）。\n",
